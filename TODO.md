# TODO

Future work only — nothing here is done. Decisions already made, and the
measurements behind them, live in [`specs/design.md`](specs/design.md);
behaviour that ships lives in [`docs/`](docs/).

Limitations that ship — unsupported languages, excluded cross-build targets,
constructs no anchor reaches — are documented in
[`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md), not listed here.

Items below are the residual queue after a fenced wave landed design-record
alignment for `blame --follow-rename`, help/USAGE drift closeout for
per-segment `--max-count` and `pwsh` in top-level help, and regression pins
for dirty-worktree blame + per-segment log max-count (plus wave-audit
should-fix closeout).
Deliberately not queued: `rgit restore` (designed and held back —
[`specs/design.md`](specs/design.md#rgit-restore-filesymbol-an-accepted-design-deliberately-not-built)),
context staged/unstaged split, TOML taplo / SQL LSP cross-checks, Rust/C/C++/
Vue/Svelte grammars, SCSS/zsh, and orphan-gopls handshake cleanup.
