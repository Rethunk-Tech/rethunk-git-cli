# TODO

Future work only — nothing here is done. Decisions already made, and the
measurements behind them, live in [`specs/design.md`](specs/design.md);
behaviour that ships lives in [`docs/`](docs/).

Limitations that ship — unsupported languages, excluded cross-build targets,
constructs no anchor reaches — are documented in
[`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md), not listed here.

Items below are the residual queue after index-as-existence, `--only`,
promisor-missing blobs, `--pathspec-from-file`, and `--reuse-message` with
zero targets. Deliberately not queued:
`rgit restore` (designed and held back —
[`specs/design.md`](specs/design.md#rgit-restore-filesymbol-an-accepted-design-deliberately-not-built)),
context staged/unstaged split, TOML taplo / SQL LSP cross-checks, Rust/C/C++/
Vue/Svelte grammars, SCSS/zsh, JSONC/JSON5, orphan-gopls handshake cleanup,
`--include`/`-a`, and any web/shadcn surface (this is a CLI;
`@shadcn/command` does not apply).

## Completion / tooling

- [ ] **pwsh e2e completion pins (symbols + silent degrade).** bash/zsh/fish
      already have dynamic `FILE:SYMBOL` e2e coverage in
      `cmd/rgit/rgit_e2e_test.go`; pwsh only has parser validation in
      `internal/app/app_test.go`. Optional sibling: one bash/fish case that
      `symbols --` offers `--for-commit`.

      **Packages / files:** `cmd/rgit/rgit_e2e_test.go` (mirror fish/bash
      patterns), optionally `CONTRIBUTING.md` e2e table once pwsh is real.

      **Acceptance criteria:** `go test ./cmd/rgit -run 'TestCompletion_Pwsh'`
      (or equivalent) proves symbol completion and silent failure outside a
      repo; CONTRIBUTING may then list pwsh beside bash/zsh/fish.
